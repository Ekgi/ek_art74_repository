<p class="p1">Choosing to break off from the road you walk back into the treeline. But after only a couple feet you arrive at another road. Confused you look up and down the road and see that it's nearly identical to the other. Passing through the next line of trees you end up at another road. With the fog surrounding you it's impossible to see how long this repeats for. You continue to sprint through trees running over a multitude of identical roads with nothing ever changing. If only you turned back sooner.</p>
